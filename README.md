#MPI Parallel Programing

This work presents a detailed performance analysis of the functions of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) functionality and makes a direct comparison with an implementation of the same functionalities using **MPI_Send** and **MPI_Recv** peer-to-peer communication. In addition, an algorithm for multiplying an array by a vector with column distribution instead of lines is presented.
